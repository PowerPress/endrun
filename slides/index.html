	    <h3>No Internet Use</h3>
	    <p>We're making an end run around the Internet. Because someone has to.
	    </p>
	    <aside class="notes">
	    Endrun is designed to make an ``end run'' around the Internet, for the purpose of giving a communications option to people who cannot use the Internet. This could happen for any of several reasons: the Internet could have suffered a major regional or global failure, due to natural disaster, accident, or hostility; the Internet might be considered untrustworthy, due to adversary action; or the areas being communicated across might be so remote that Internet connectivity is simply not a useful option.

	      <li>Amateur Radio*</li>
	    </ul>
	    <aside class="notes">
	    Endrun is "by any means necessary." Endrun is designed to work across any form of communication that is available, whether that's physical data movement and low-power transient unlicensed radio links, as we would recommend, or by Earth-Moon-Earth (EME) high-powered signals from fix points, or even amateur (ham) radio. The only firm requirement for Endrun is a USB port; as we'll see later, that's more powerful than you might think.

	    <h3>Old-School Cellular Communications</h3>
	    <p>Cell as in "group", not cell as in "for the enjoyment of all patrons, please turn off your"</p>
	    <aside class="notes">
	    Endrun is designed for communications between small groups of people---``cells'' or ``pods.'' It is not designed for open-ended communication between people that have no prior relationship.

	      <li>Hostile terrain (inc. N. Scotland, Scandinavia, the southern U.S.)</li>
	      <li>SPAAAAAAAAAACE!</li>
	    </ul>
	    <aside class="notes">
	    Endrun is disruption- and delay-tolerant. It is designed to work where nodes have no real- or bounded-time connection to each other, for instance, when couriers are moving data stored on physical media either around town or across a continent.

	    <h3>Modifiable On the Fly</h3>
	    <p>This isn't an Exchange Server. You know your needs better than we do.</p>
	    <aside class="notes">
	    Endrun is built using standard, well-tested, open source components and combined using Python, rather than using all custom code. This lets Endrun benefit from decades of work from thousands of programmers (with all the attendant work on security that implies). It also means that Endrun is customizable by programmers in the field; in an emergency situation, this can give flexibility that fully-custom solutions cannot.

	    <aside class="notes">
	    Add notes here.
	    Basic idea: Tor provides privacy by encrypting communication at every relay using different keys. However, exit nodes are the weakpoint, and an adversary with sufficient resources could control the majority of end nodes.

	    <aside class="notes">
	    Airchat provides secure encrypted messaging, but uses amateur radio and is illegal in the US under part 97 of the FCC rules. Other countries have similar restrictions, so it's illegal there too. It also relies on semi-permanent high-power radio links, which means anyone with a couple of directional antennas can ruin your day by calling in air support, or as we call it, "connection reset by missile".

	    <aside class="notes">
	    Commotion Wireless creates ad-hoc mesh networks using regular 802.11a/b/g/n hardware. Pretty cool. In a "zombie apocalypse", this would work pretty well. However, wifi is semi-permanent wireless radio. Wifi has the same problems we described above.

	    <h3>NASA/ESA Delay-Tolerant Networking</h3>
	    <em>Close, but no appropriations</em>
	    <aside class="notes">
	    DTN has been around since the early 90s when Vint Cerf stated working on the InterPlaNet. It solves most of the problems we described above: it'll handle long delays, transient links,  multiple transport paths, etc. However, security is a second-tier concern if it's considered at all. Also, for the most part, DTN has been an academic exercise, limited to university research teams with grant funding from NASA or ESA. It's never been implemented the same way twice, and the closest we've come to having a standard implementation of it -- in the form of NASA's proposed Mars Telecommunications Orbiter -- fell victim to the Appropriations Committee of the United States Congress.

	    <h2>Endrun 101</h2>
	    <aside class="notes">
  	    <p>Ok, now we get into the particulars. Like we said, DTN is the closest existing concept to what we want to do. However, it's never been implemented the same way twice, and it has security holes you could drive a boat through. So, using existing software, we put together our own secure implementation of the DTN protocol using:</p>
  	    <ul>
  	      <li>Git</li>
  	      <li>LibSodium</li>
  	      <li>Some Python to glue everything together</li>
  	    </ul>
	    And called it Endrun. 
	    </aside>
	  </section>
	  <section data-state="endrun-101" data-background="photos/e101_git.jpg">
	    <h3>Git</h3>
	    <p>Git solves many of the problems that a DTN faces.</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Information order</li>
	      <li>Information integrity</li>
	      <li>Information divergence</li>
	    </ul>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      <p>There are a lot of problems with putting together a networking protocol; stuff shows up in the wrong order, stuff shows up mangled, stuff... doesn't show up, stuff shows up twice. Same goes for DTN. However, because of the latency concerns, we can't just throw TCP at it and call it good enough.</p>
	      <p>It turns out this problem already has a solution. Git resolves:</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>Information showing up in the wrong order</li>
	      </ul>

	  <section data-state="endrun-101" data-background="photos/e101_bundle.jpg">
	    <h3>Git Bundles</h3>
	    <p>Bundles let us "fake" remote repos.</p>
	    <p>From the man page:</p>
	    <p>
	    <pre>
	    This command provides support for git fetch and git pull 
	    to operate by packaging objects and references in an 
	    archive at the originating machine, then importing those 
	    into another repository using git fetch and git pull after 
	    moving the archive by some means.
	    </pre>
	    </p>
	    <p>Look, ma! No network connection!</p>
	    <aside class="notes">
	    Git bundles are a way of using a file to connect to a remote repo instead of a network connection. They were originally intended for air-gap situations and contexts in which people have either high latency or low bandwidth. We have all three, so naturally, it's a perfect fit.

	    We use a routing algorithm referred to by its designers as "spray-and-wait" as a way to get the best of store-and-forward routing (hold it until you can move it) without flooding a network with tons of packets (which, if you're using radio, means almost constant radio traffic).
