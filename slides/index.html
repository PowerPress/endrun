	    <h3>Brendan</h3>
	    Endrun is "by any means necessary." Endrun is designed to work across any form of communication that is available, whether that's physical data movement and low-power transient unlicensed radio links, as we would recommend, or by Earth-Moon-Earth (EME) high-powered signals from fix points, or even amateur (ham) radio. The only firm requirement for Endrun is a USB port; as we'll see later, that's more powerful than you might think.

	    <aside class="notes">
	    <h3>Brendan</h3>
	    Endrun is designed for communications between small groups of people---``cells'' or ``pods.'' It is not designed for open-ended communication between people that have no prior relationship.

	    <p>Because our system can be used in really nasty places where the trains don't always run on time, Endrun is disruption- and delay-tolerant.</p>
	    <p>It is designed to work where nodes have no real- or bounded-time connection to each other</p> 
	    <p>Because it's medium-agnostic, will work in places where the internet has traditionally been difficult to use</p>

	    <aside class="notes">
	    <h3>Brendan</h3>
	    We come from the amateur radio community, where any components can be the right components and everything should be interchangeable. With that in mind, Endrun is built using standard, well-tested, open source components and put together using Python, rather than using all custom code. This lets Endrun benefit from decades of work from thousands of programmers (with all the attendant work on security that implies). It also means that Endrun is customizable by programmers in the field; in an emergency situation, this can give flexibility that fully-custom solutions cannot.

	    You've heard of Tor, of course. Tor provides privacy by encrypting communication at every relay using different keys. However, exit nodes are the weakpoint, and an adversary with sufficient resources could control the majority of end nodes.

	    <h3>Grant</h3>
	    Anonymous came up with a Airchat provides secure encrypted messaging, but uses amateur radio and is illegal in the US under part 97 of the FCC rules. Other countries have similar restrictions, so it's illegal there too. It also relies on semi-permanent high-power radio links, which means anyone with a couple of directional antennas can ruin your day by calling in air support, or as we call it, "connection reset by missile".

	    Commotion Wireless creates ad-hoc mesh networks using regular 802.11a/b/g/n hardware. Pretty cool. In a "zombie apocalypse", this would work pretty well. However, wifi is semi-permanent wireless radio. Wifi has the same problems we described above.

	    <em>Close, but no appropriations</em>
	    <aside class="notes">
	    <h3>Grant</h3>
	    DTN has been around since the early 90s when Vint Cerf stated working on the InterPlaNet. It solves most of the problems we described above: it'll handle long delays, transient links,  multiple transport paths, etc. However, security is a second-tier concern if it's considered at all. Also, for the most part, DTN has been an academic exercise, limited to university research teams with grant funding from NASA or ESA. It's never been implemented the same way twice, and the closest we've come to having a standard implementation of it -- in the form of NASA's proposed Mars Telecommunications Orbiter -- fell victim to the Appropriations Committee of the United States Congress.

	      <li>However, it's never been implemented the same way twice</li>
	      <li>Binary protocol, which makes it hard to parse</li>

	    <p>
	    <pre>
	    This command provides support for git fetch and git pull 
	    to operate by packaging objects and references in an 
	    archive at the originating machine, then importing those 
	    into another repository using git fetch and git pull after 
	    moving the archive by some means.

	    <li>Create bundle at point A, push to it</li>

	      <li>Bleeding-edge elliptical-curve cryptography</p></li>

	    <aside class="notes">
	    <h3>Brendan</h3>
	    <p>Git solves our data control problems. However, outside of hashing and the occasional tag or commit signing, it doesn't really do crypto. </p>
	    <p>We wanted the best crypto we could find. Our intended use cases deserve no less than that. So we looked around, and decided on Salt. Salt is an elliptical-curve cryptography framework developed by Daniel J. Bernstein of the University of Chicago. It is incredibly fast, has very low overhead, and very secure -- OpenDNS uses it to secure their backhaul.  However, it's written in C. With hardware-specific compiler flags. That means unless you have a thing for makefiles, it's only guaranteed to run correctly if your name is Daniel J. Bernstein and you're sitting in front of your office computer.</p>

	    <h3>LibSodium</h3>
	    <p>LibSodium is a wrapper around NaCl developed by the friendly folks at OpenDNS.</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Has bindings in a number of different languages (Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.)</li>
	      <li>Much easier to work with</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>Endrun uses LibSodium to sign, encrypt, and sign bundles before they are added to Endrun payloads.</p>
	    <aside class="notes">
	    <h3>Brendan</h3>
	    <p>Luckily, this problem has *also* been solved for us. The OpenDNS people wanted to use Salt, and didn't want to sentence their devops team to compiling salt on every server architecture variant they have, so they developed libsodium. Libsodium is a platform- and language-independent wrapper around salt. It has good performance compared to the natively-compiled C binaries, has bindings for most of today's common development languages, and will run on pretty much anything with a PRNG.</p>
	    <p>We can't directly encrypt the data stored *in* a git repository, so instead we sign and encrypt bundles, then sign them again before they're ready for transport. </p>
	    </aside>
	  </section>
	  <section data-state="endrun-101" data-background="photos/e101_payload.jpg">
	    <h3>Payload Format</h3>
	    <p>Payloads are how Endrun moves data around. Each payload contains:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Origin node identifier</li>
	      <li>Destination node identifier</li>
	      <li>Timestamp (TTL)</li>
	      <li>Contents</li>
	      <li>Chain of Custody data</li>
	      <li>Copies</li>
	    </ul>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      <h3>Grant</h3>
	      <p>That brings us to payloads. In Endrun, a payload is a nice little serialized package with the encrypted git bundle and its routing data. We have origin and destination, for which we use the salt public key fingerprints. We have an epoc timestamp that is used for determining time to live, our bundle, and then we have our chain of custody data -- more about that in a minute.</p>

	      <li>8 double keypairs are created</li>
