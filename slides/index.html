	      Endrun is "by any means necessary." Endrun is designed to work across any form of communication that is available, whether that's physical data movement and low-power transient unlicensed radio links, as we would recommend, or by Earth-Moon-Earth (EME) high-powered signals from fix points, or even amateur (ham) radio. The only firm requirement for Endrun is a USB port; as we'll see later, that's more powerful than you might think.

	      <h3>Brendan</h3>
	      Endrun is designed for communications between small groups of people---``cells'' or ``pods.'' It is not designed for open-ended communication between people that have no prior relationship.

	      <p>It is designed to work where nodes have no real- or bounded-time connection to each other</p> 
	      <p>Because it's medium-agnostic, will work in places where the internet has traditionally been difficult to use</p>

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <h3>Brendan</h3>
	      We come from the amateur radio community, where any components can be the right components and everything should be interchangeable. With that in mind, Endrun is built using standard, well-tested, open source components and put together using Python, rather than using all custom code. This lets Endrun benefit from decades of work from thousands of programmers (with all the attendant work on security that implies). It also means that Endrun is customizable by programmers in the field; in an emergency situation, this can give flexibility that fully-custom solutions cannot.

	      <h3>Brendan</h3>
	      <p>You've heard of Tor, of course. Tor provides privacy by encrypting communication at every relay using different keys.</p>

	      <p>Here's the issue: the original Tor paper stated that any adversary who could observe either the entry and exit nodes, or who can control a simple majority of all Tor nodes, can compromise the privacy guarantees. Just using Amazon EC2, it would only take about US$50K/month to double the amount of Tor nodes (thus controlling 50%), so that's a realistic threat from *any* large organization.</p>

	      <p>With respect to entry/exit monitoring, a Harvard undergraduate who wanted to skip a business ethics final found this out the great way.</p>

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <h3>Brendan</h3>
	      Commotion Wireless creates community mesh networks using special firmware for Linksys WiFi routers; it's designed to share an Internet connection in an underserved area. Byzantium uses consumer laptops, and is designed to provide simple user services (chat, wiki, etc.) with no Internet at all---they bill themselves as a mesh network for a zombie apocalypse. We assume, and have citations in our whitepaper on this point, that zombies don't know how to use automatic direction finding missiles. For non-zombie situations, however, we think this is problematic as discussed with AirChat.

	    This command provides support for git fetch and git pull

	      <p>Git solves our data control problems. However, outside of hashing and the occasional tag or commit signing, it doesn't really do crypto. </p>
	      <p>We wanted the best crypto we could find. Our intended use cases deserve no less than that. So we looked around, and decided on Salt. Salt is an elliptical-curve cryptography framework developed by Daniel J. Bernstein of the University of Chicago. It is incredibly fast, has very low overhead, and very secure -- OpenDNS uses it to secure their backhaul.  However, it's written in C. With hardware-specific compiler flags. That means unless you have a thing for makefiles, it's only guaranteed to run correctly if your name is Daniel J. Bernstein and you're sitting in front of your office computer.</p>

	    <h3>LibSodium</h3>
      <em><p>NaCl, as fixed by OpenDNS.
	    <p>LibSodium is a wrapper around NaCl developed by the friendly folks at OpenDNS.</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Has bindings in a number of different languages (Python, Ruby, PHP, even Haskell!)</li>
	      <li>Much easier to work with</li>
	    </ul></em>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      <h3>Brendan</h3>
	      <p>Luckily, this problem has *also* been solved for us. The OpenDNS people wanted to use Salt, and didn't want to sentence their devops team to compiling salt on every server architecture variant they have, so they developed libsodium. Libsodium is a platform- and language-independent wrapper around salt. It has good performance compared to the natively-compiled C binaries, has bindings for most of today's common development languages, and will run on pretty much anything with a PRNG.</p>
	      <p>We can't directly encrypt the data stored *in* a git repository, so instead we sign and encrypt bundles, then sign them again before they're ready for transport. </p>

	  <section data-state="endrun-101" data-background="photos/e101_payload.jpg">
	    <h3>Payload Format</h3>
	    <p>Payloads are how Endrun moves data around. Each payload contains:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Origin node identifier</li>
	      <li>Destination node identifier</li>
	      <li>Timestamp (TTL)</li>

	    <aside class="notes">
	      <h3>Grant</h3>
	      <p>That brings us to payloads. In Endrun, a payload is a nice little serialized package with the encrypted git bundle and its routing data. We have origin and destination, for which we use the salt public key fingerprints. We have an epoc timestamp that is used for determining time to live, our bundle, and then we have our chain of custody data -- more about that in a minute.</p>

	      <p>Basic idea</p>
	      <ul>
		<li>Set an upper bound, in this case, 8.</li>
		<li>First round, the payload is sent to 8 nodes (or every node we can find).</li>
		<li>Second round, every node with a copy sends it to 4 nodes (half rounded down)</li>
		<li>Third round, every node with a copy sends it to 2 nodes (half rounded down)</li>
		<li>Fourth round, nodes should only have one copy; they hold onto it and wait for direct contact (or TTL death)</li>

	    <h3>Chain of Custody</h3>
	    <p>Endrun does not maintain a routing table, or any global knowledge of the network. This has some downsides:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Nodes can be compromised without immediate knowledge</li>
	      <li>Bandwidth can be wasted trying to contact nodes that have moved or are no longer available</li>
	      <li>I can't route data to people I don't know</li>
	    </ul>
	    <aside class="notes">
	      <h3>Grant</h3>
	      <p>Chain of custody solves these issues without requiring global knowledge</p>
	      <p>We set up chain of custody in 3 parts: a record on the payload itself, a receipt table, and a map table</p>
	      <p>The Chain of custody on the node is just an array of receipts.</p>
	      <p>Each receipt is recipient node ID, timestamp of receipt, and hash of the payload at that time.</p>
	      <p>Everytime the payload is passed, a receipt is appended to the array.</p>

	      <p>Every time one node encounters another (by receiving data from it) a record is made in the table.</p>
	      <p>Anytime we prepare to hand off data, we check this table first; if we haven't "seen" a node in a while, we avoid it</p>

        <p>Rotating fingerprints in some time period allows nodes to prevent long-term data leakage from identifying the nodes on capture. It's just a good additional precaution, and it's possible, e.g., in GPG.</p>
	      <p>Chain of custody gives you everything you need for an audit trail</p>
